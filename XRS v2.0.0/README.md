Xylitol.Release.System.v2.0.0_Tool_OTHER-RED
============================================

The front page design and CSS is based on the RAiD release portal (http://raid.astalavista.ms/).

Public release: final version 2.0.0 (2018)

This CMS is made for all web cracking crews, individuals, and all who want to keep the scene alive and run a decent portal to track releases.
And mainly for all guys who are site operators and who are not good at PHP coding (cheers my friends!)
If you dont like the code/design just edit it, i have tried to make the PHP more simple than possible, with no vulnerability problem, clean and light code etc...
I hope you will enjoy my release system :)

Thanks you for your interest on this.

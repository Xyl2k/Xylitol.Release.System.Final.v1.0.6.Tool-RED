The front page design and CSS is based on the RAiD release portal (http://raid.astalavista.ms/).

Public release: final version 1.0.6

This CMS is made for all cracking crews, individuals, for all those who keep strugle the scene alive.
And mainly for all guys who are site operators and are not good at PHP coding (cheers my friends!)
I aimed for it because... nobody thought to make a release portal in CMS.
If you dont like the code/design just edit it, i have tryed to make the PHP more simple than possible, with no vulnerability problem, clean and light code etc...
I hope you will enjoy my release system :)

Final words: i've made a CMS, that a first one for me, and that represent also alot of work, finally, thanks you for your interest on this.
